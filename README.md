## How to Use the Project

Follow these steps to use the website:

1. **Add Processes:**
   - Enter the arrival time and burst time for each process.
   - Click on the "Add a Row" button to add the process to the table.
   - Ensure processes are entered in order of their arrival time.

2. **Delete Processes:**
   - To remove a process, click on the "Delete a Row" button next to the process you want to delete.

3. **Select an Algorithm:**
   - Choose the scheduling algorithm you want to implement by selecting the corresponding radio button:
     - For Round Robin, enter the time quantum in the respective text field.
     - For Priority Scheduling, enter the priority for each process (lower values indicate higher priority).

4. **Execute the Algorithm:**
   - After adding all processes and selecting the algorithm, click on the "Execute" button.
   - The system will calculate and display the turnaround time, response time, completion time, and waiting time for each process.
   - Line graphs for response time, completion time, and waiting time will be displayed.
   - A Gantt Chart will also be shown to visualize the scheduling of processes over time.
